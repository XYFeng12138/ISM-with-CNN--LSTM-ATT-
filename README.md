# ISM-with-CNN--LSTM-ATT-
A novel integrated surrogate model (ISM) for rapid flood inundation simulation, combining a coupled hydrological (3S-TOPMODEL)-hydrodynamic (LISFLOOD-FP) model with a CNN-LSTM deep learning model enhanced by the Attention mechanism. And you will need to download the LISFLOOD-FP model yourself [on the site](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13121102)
